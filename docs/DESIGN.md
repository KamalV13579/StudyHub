Welcome,  
 To the new frontier of learning.  
 ---

StudyHub is a web-app dedicated to students and educators alike. It serves as a centralized platform for users to share and expand their ideas. Whenever, wherever, or whatever it may be, StudyHub strives to make learning a better experience for all.

## üöÄ Features

### üîç Collaborative Study Rooms

We wish for students to interact more with their peers. Collaborative study rooms would fulfill this much needed role in the education space. 

Collaborative study rooms are like group chat rooms on popular social media platforms, however education-oriented. Students are encouraged to share thoughts, collaborate, and post helpful material to their peers in these rooms.

#### Intended User: Students

---

### üìö Resource Repository

Ever felt lost in a class before? The student-ran resource repository will have all the resources you‚Äôll ever need to catch up.  

The resource repository is intended to serve as a helpful guide to students in a variety of courses. Whether it be math or biology, students can upload study material for their peers to view.

Moreover, it is clear that sources of study material on designated sites have become rare, where most of them are locked behind a paywall. With StudyHub‚Äôs resource repository, we hope to allow more freedom to our students.

#### Intended User: Students

---

### üë©üè´ Peer-to-Peer Tutoring

Are office-hours not fitting to your schedule, or maybe you‚Äôre not understanding EVERY concept your professor is yapping about? The peer-to-peer tutoring service on StudyHub is intended to guide students with the help of student-educators.

We not only want to provide a hub for students to collaborate, but also a place for educators to thrive as well. It‚Äôs a perfect opportunity for educators to enhance their teaching ability and students to achieve better understanding of course materials.

#### Intended User: Students, Educators

---

### üí¨ Discussion Forums

Want an impromptu chat room where you can stay anonymous? Discussion forums are the perfect gateway to ask questions and share thoughts and ideas about course material, lecture, etc.

These forums would be an easy way to give questions and answers without needing to log or sign in to StudyHub, making it a convenient way to join and collaborate on whatever it might be.

#### Intended User: Students

---

### ü§ñ In-App Chatbot

Maybe you don‚Äôt want to talk to anyone, but have questions you desperately want answered. StudyHub will host an in-app chatbot to help out with homework, conceptual; or any question in general.

We desire an environment that coalesces learning, so what better way than to host a permanent buddy to answer your questions.

#### Intended User: Students

## üóÑÔ∏è Backend Data Schema

Our database structure:

![comp426schema1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6293d1b0-853f-4339-8925-a0c506925172)

![comp426schema2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1caee771-d6aa-4a99-b8b9-2c7233c78a18)

![comp426schema3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1cd0aa37-56cb-4e10-add3-62e371fa0969)

Our database is designed to store information on the different users/profiles, study rooms, discussion forums, tutoring sessions, and resources. 

We store the membership information of users in membership tables corresponding to study rooms, forums, and courses. For study rooms, we created 3 different tables to store the study room information, the user membership, and the message data. Similar strategies are utlized for the other entities/features to normalize the data as well, as storing all the information of a single entity in a single table can lead to redundency and inconsistency. To maintain data integrity, we utilize foreign keys in our relations, as shown in the schema visualizations above.

There were some project-specific considerations we had to take into account as well. For instance, in the forum membership table, we store whether or not the user wants to be anonymous on that forum or not.
This allows the user to decide if they want to remain anonymous or not on the forum when they sign up for the forum. We use a similar method to store whether or not a user is a tutor or not in the course
membership table. We also created a separate table to store the upvotes/downvotes of resources to allow users to let eachother know of a resource is good or not. Also, in the resource table, we have a column for type that has a custom enumerated data type called resource type. This allows us to limit the types of resources to Study Guide, Lecture Notes, Supplemental, and Other.

## üé® High-Fidelity Prototype

We've used Figma to create a basic mock-up of three of our features:

Our template:

### Collaborative Study Rooms

<img width="700" alt="Untitled" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ef0380d-4ca6-4310-a7b4-c39d4bde29c0" />


1. Here, 'user' clicks 'Project Help' channel under COMP426-SP25's course drop-down.
<br>

<img width="700" alt="input" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a5c5492-0f1e-457f-8718-a2da41e6cfe6" />


2. 'user' sends in a message, which shows to every user in the channel, shown on the right.
<br>

<img width="700" alt="message 1 sent" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e4c282c3-4056-4551-b9ca-064a9b95f901" />


3. Underneath the chatbox, you can see another person, 'user2' typing.
<br>

4. When 'user2' finishes typing, they upload their message in realtime, allowing 'user' to get live-updates from the channel.
<br>

<img width="700" alt="join new group" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a594c9c5-4fed-4c7e-ab5b-6e9f58b73e52" />


5. 'user' wants to join another channel. A form pops up, allowing 'user' to choose a course subject, its number, and a room code to join a specific channel. Finally, 'user' can mark the checkbox to be declared as an educator.
<br>

<img width="700" alt="new group added" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c4cbd25-6d9e-4e6e-8bd3-65742e85e717" />


6. 'user' then joins a new channel.
<br>

<img width="700" alt="message 3 sent" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a45ac7e-d78c-4127-90a6-4b8c01454c15" />


7. Here, functionality extends across different channels.

6. 'user2' accepts the request, guiding them to a newly created two-person channel. There's also a note for the tutor to refer back to 'user's original request.
<br>
