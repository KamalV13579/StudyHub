### Welcome, <br>
to the new frontier of studying.

## üöÄ Features

### üîç Collaborative Study Rooms

We wish for students to interact more with their peers. Collaborative study rooms would fulfill this much needed role in the education space. 

Collaborative study rooms are like group chat rooms on popular social media platforms, however education-oriented. Students are encouraged to share thoughts, collaborate, and post helpful material to their peers in these rooms.

#### Intended User: Students

---

### üìö Resource Repository

Ever felt lost in a class before? The student-ran resource repository will have all the resources you‚Äôll ever need to catch up.  

The resource repository is intended to serve as a helpful guide to students in a variety of courses. Whether it be math or biology, students can upload study material for their peers to view.

Moreover, it is clear that sources of study material on designated sites have become rare, where most of them are locked behind a paywall. With StudyHub‚Äôs resource repository, we hope to allow more freedom to our students.

#### Intended User: Students

### üë©üè´ Peer-to-Peer Tutoring

Are office-hours not fitting to your schedule, or maybe you‚Äôre not understanding EVERY concept your professor is yapping about? The peer-to-peer tutoring service on StudyHub is intended to guide students with the help of student-educators.

We not only want to provide a hub for students to collaborate, but also a place for educators to thrive as well. It‚Äôs a perfect opportunity for educators to enhance their teaching ability and students to achieve better understanding of course materials.

#### Intended User: Students, Educators

---

### üí¨ Discussion Forums

Want an impromptu chat room where you can stay anonymous? Discussion forums are the perfect gateway to ask questions and share thoughts and ideas about course material, lecture, etc.

These forums would be an easy way to give questions and answers without needing to log or sign in to StudyHub, making it a convenient way to join and collaborate on whatever it might be.

#### Intended User: Students

---

### ü§ñ In-App Chatbot

Maybe you don‚Äôt want to talk to anyone, but have questions you desperately want answered. StudyHub will host an in-app chatbot to help out with homework, conceptual; or any question in general.

We desire an environment that coalesces learning, so what better way than to host a permanent buddy to answer your questions.

#### Intended User: Students

## üé® High-Fidelity Prototype

We've used Figma to create a basic mock-up of three of our features:

Our template:
